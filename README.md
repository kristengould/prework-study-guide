# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## The purpose of this webpage is to consolidate the information I learned through the bootcamp prework in order to provide myself and other coding-beginners with an easy-access study guide. Instead of searching through all the class modules for coding guidance, we can now navigate to this single source for all the information we need.
